# Gigantic Amethyst
The Gigantic Amethyst is an equipment item from the original Risk of Rain that reset all ability cooldowns.
Since Risk of Rain 2 allows certain abilities to have stacks this will reset all abilities to full stock.
May not work with custom characters, depends on load order.
For those of you who are looking for a longer cooldown, consider using the L version.
